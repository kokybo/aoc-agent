### Agentic Problem Solver

## Current State
The current code can solve simple problems from the first couple days.
Around mid way through it starts to get less effective at solving the problems.

The solution currently works best with o1 (though it can spend nearly a dollar in API costs to solve a single problem)
It has been tested with 4o and that works to some level, but struggles with more complex problems.
03-mini also seems to work pretty well

## Future Work
1. Implement solving part two.
    1. Have the user enter the part two problem.
    2. Have the agent develop an updated solution interactively
