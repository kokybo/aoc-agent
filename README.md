### Agentic Problem Solver

## Current State
The current code can solve simple problems from the first couple days.
Around mid way through it starts to get less effective at solving the problems.

## Future Work
1. Implement interactive solving. 
    1. Have the agent develop a solution, then test the solution automatically and produce an answer.
    2. Once and answer is produced a user should provide feedback and then the AI should respond to that
1. Implement solving part two.
    1. Have the user enter the part two problem.
    2. Have the agent develop an updated solution interactively
